# Tetris

## Dependencies
Built with Visual studio 2022 Community edition.
The project is dependent on raylib library, available [here](https://www.raylib.com/). I installed it with vcpkg.
Alternatively you can download the latest release from releases tab and run the executable file.

## Platforms
The application is built with WINAPI so it is will compile on windows only. 
To compile on other platforms modify the main file as needed.
